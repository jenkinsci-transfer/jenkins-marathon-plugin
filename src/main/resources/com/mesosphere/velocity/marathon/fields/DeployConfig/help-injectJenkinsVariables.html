        This parameter decides whether to inject a few Jenkins Environment Variables into the deployment as Environment Variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this is set to <code>true</code> (checked), then the following Environment Variables will be injected:
        <ul>
            <li>JENKINS_BUILD_NUMBER = ${BUILD_NUMBER}</li>
            <li>JENKINS_JOB_NAME = ${JOB_NAME}</li>
            <li>JENKINS_GIT_COMMIT = ${GIT_COMMIT}</li>
        </ul>
        If this is set to <code>false</code> (unchecked), then none of these variables will be injected.
    </p>
